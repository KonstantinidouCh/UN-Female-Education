**Fundamentals of Data Science - Assignment 1**

University of Amsterdam

Overview

This repository contains the materials and code for Assignment 1 of the Fundamentals of Data Science course at the University of Amsterdam. The focus of this assignment is to apply data science techniques to explore socio-economic factors surrounding women's education and to make predictions based on current global discourse.

Objectives

This assignment aims to investigate various socio-economic variables and their potential correlations with women's education using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and others for data analysis and visualization.

The project is divided into two main sections:

1. Exploratory Analysis
We will analyze available datasets to answer the following exploratory questions:

What socio-economic factors are frequently discussed alongside women’s education?
Are certain socio-economic variables (e.g., poverty, employment, technology access) often linked with women’s education?
Is there a correlation between speeches on women’s education and the economic and social development of countries 
(e.g., GDP, happiness index, social support, freedom of choice)?

2. Predictive Analysis
We will apply predictive modeling to answer:

What will be the future sentiment or tone surrounding discussions of women’s education?
Can we predict shifts in sentiment (positive or negative) based on current trends in global discourse?
Datasets

The datasets used in this project include:

Socio-economic data (e.g., GDP, poverty rates, access to technology)
Education statistics
Global happiness and freedom indices
Textual data from speeches and articles discussing women’s education
These datasets will be cleaned and preprocessed using Pandas for analysis and visualization purposes.

Tools and Libraries

The analysis will leverage the following Python libraries:

Pandas for data manipulation
NumPy for numerical computations
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
NLTK or TextBlob for sentiment analysis
Scikit-learn for predictive modeling
